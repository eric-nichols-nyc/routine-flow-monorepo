         * CONTENT-SECURITY-POLICY (CSP)
         * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
         * The most powerful security header. Controls which resources the
         * browser is allowed to load for your page.
         *
         * How it prevents XSS:
         * - Even if an attacker injects <script>alert('xss')</script>, the
         *   browser BLOCKS it because inline scripts aren't in the policy
         * - Attackers can't load scripts from evil.com because only 'self' is allowed
         *
         * Directive breakdown:
         * - default-src 'self'     → Only load resources from same origin by default
         * - script-src 'self'      → Only allow scripts from same origin
         *   'unsafe-inline'        → Required for Next.js in development
         *   'unsafe-eval'          → Required for Next.js hot reload in dev
         * - style-src 'self'       → Allow styles from same origin
         *   'unsafe-inline'        → Allow inline styles (needed for many CSS-in-JS)
         *                            ⚠️ Weaker than nonces, but often necessary
         * - img-src 'self' data: https: → Images from same origin, data URIs, or any HTTPS
         * - font-src 'self'        → Fonts only from same origin
         *
         * ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT vs PRODUCTION:
         * This CSP includes 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' for development.
         * In production, use nonces instead:
         *   script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}'
         * Next.js can generate nonces - see: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy
         *
         * Production tip: Use 'report-uri' or 'report-to' to log violations
         * without blocking, then tighten the policy based on real data.

         * Prevents your site from being embedded in <iframe>, <frame>, <embed>, or <object>
         *
         * How it prevents clickjacking:
         * - Attacker creates a page with your site in an invisible iframe
         * - They overlay fake UI elements and trick users into clicking
         * - User thinks they're clicking attacker's button, but actually
         *   clicking a button on YOUR site (e.g., "Delete Account")

         * Values:
         * - DENY              → Never allow framing (most secure)

         * - ALLOW-FROM uri    → Only allow specific origin (deprecated)
         *
         * Modern alternative: Use CSP's frame-ancestors directive instead
         * Example: frame-ancestors 'none' (equivalent to DENY)

         * based on file contents instead of trusting the Content-Type header.
         *
         * How it prevents attacks:
         * - Attacker uploads malicious.jpg that's actually JavaScript
         * - Without nosniff, browser might execute it as JavaScript
         * - With nosniff, browser strictly respects Content-Type header
         *
         * Always set to 'nosniff' — there's no downside.

         * Why it matters:
         * - URLs can contain sensitive data (tokens, user IDs, search queries)
         * - Example: /reset-password?token=abc123 — you don't want that leaked
         *
         * Common values:
         * - no-referrer                    → Never send referrer (most private)
         * - same-origin                    → Only send to same origin
         * - strict-origin-when-cross-origin → Send origin (not full URL) to
         *                                     other sites, full URL to same origin
         *                                     ✅ Good balance of privacy & functionality
