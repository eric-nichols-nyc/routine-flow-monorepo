/**
 * =============================================================================
 * SECURITY LAB: Rate Limiting Demo API
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * This endpoint demonstrates rate limiting in action. Try hitting it rapidly
 * to see rate limiting kick in.
 *
 * TEST IT:
 * --------
 * # Hit the endpoint multiple times rapidly
 * for i in {1..15}; do curl -s http://localhost:3005/api/rate-limit-demo | jq; done
 *
 * # You'll see successful responses, then 429 errors after the limit
 *
 * REAL-WORLD USE CASES:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. LOGIN ENDPOINTS
 *    Limit: 5-10 attempts per minute per IP
 *    Why: Prevents brute force password attacks
 *    Example: After 5 failed logins, require CAPTCHA or temporary lockout
 *
 * 2. PASSWORD RESET
 *    Limit: 3-5 requests per hour per email
 *    Why: Prevents email bombing and enumeration
 *    Example: Attacker can't spam password reset to discover valid emails
 *
 * 3. SIGNUP/REGISTRATION
 *    Limit: 3-5 per hour per IP
 *    Why: Prevents mass account creation (spam, fraud)
 *    Example: Bot can't create 10,000 accounts for spam campaigns
 *
 * 4. SEARCH/AUTOCOMPLETE
 *    Limit: 30-60 per minute per user
 *    Why: Prevents data harvesting and excessive database load
 *    Example: Competitor can't scrape your entire product catalog
 *
 * 5. FILE UPLOADS
 *    Limit: 10-20 per hour per user
 *    Why: Prevents storage abuse and DoS
 *    Example: User can't fill up your S3 bucket with garbage
 *
 * 6. AI/ML ENDPOINTS
 *    Limit: Based on cost per request
 *    Why: AI APIs are expensive — one runaway script could cost thousands
 *    Example: GPT-4 costs ~$0.03/request — 100k requests = $3,000
 *
 * 7. PAYMENT/CHECKOUT
 *    Limit: 5-10 per minute per user
 *    Why: Prevents card testing fraud (testing stolen cards)
 *    Example: Fraudster can't test 1000 stolen card numbers per minute
 *
 * 8. PUBLIC APIs
 *    Limit: Tiered by API key/plan
 *    Why: Fair usage, monetization, protection
 *    Example: Free tier = 100/day, Pro = 10,000/day, Enterprise = unlimited

 * 2. The proxy is configured to set/override this header
 *
 * In production, consider:
 * - Vercel: request.headers.get('x-real-ip')
