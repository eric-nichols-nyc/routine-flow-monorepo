/**
 * =============================================================================
 * SECURITY LAB: CSRF Protection Demo API
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * This endpoint demonstrates CSRF token validation for state-changing operations.
 *
 * THE ATTACK WE'RE PREVENTING:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Without CSRF protection, an attacker could create a page like:
 *
 *   <html>
 *     <body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
 *       <form action="http://localhost:3005/api/csrf-demo" method="POST">
 *         <input name="action" value="delete_account">
 *       </form>
 *     </body>
 *   </html>
 *
 * If a logged-in user visits this page, their browser would:
 * 1. Submit the form to your server
 * 2. Automatically include their session cookies
 * 3. Your server would process it as a legitimate request
 *
 * WITH CSRF protection:
 * - The attacker's form can't include the CSRF token
 * - They can't read our cookies (same-origin policy blocks this)
 * - The request is rejected with 403 Forbidden
 *
 * TEST THIS:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Step 1: Get a CSRF token
 *   curl http://localhost:3005/api/csrf-demo -c cookies.txt
 *
 * Step 2: Submit with valid token (succeeds)
 *   TOKEN=$(cat cookies.txt | grep csrf_token | awk '{print $7}')
 *   curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/csrf-demo \
 *     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *     -b cookies.txt \
 *     -d "{\"csrf_token\":\"$TOKEN\",\"action\":\"transfer\",\"amount\":100}"
 *
 * Step 3: Submit without token (fails - simulates CSRF attack)
 *   curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/csrf-demo \
 *     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *     -b cookies.txt \
 *     -d '{"action":"transfer","amount":100}'
 *
 * Step 4: Submit with wrong token (fails)
 *   curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/csrf-demo \
 *     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *     -b cookies.txt \
 *     -d '{"csrf_token":"fake-token","action":"transfer","amount":100}'

/**
 * =============================================================================
 * REAL-WORLD IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * 1. WHEN TO USE CSRF PROTECTION
 *    - All state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
 *    - Form submissions
 *    - Any action that modifies user data or settings
 *    - NOT needed for GET requests (they should be idempotent)
 *
 * 2. FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION
 *    - Most frameworks (Django, Rails, Laravel) have built-in CSRF
 *    - Next.js doesn't have built-in CSRF — you need to add it
 *    - Libraries like 'csrf' or 'csurf' can help
 *
 * 3. SPA CONSIDERATIONS
 *    - For SPAs, the custom header approach works well
 *    - Generate token on login, store in memory (not localStorage!)
 *    - Send token in X-CSRF-Token header with every request
 *
 * 4. TOKEN ROTATION
 *    - Some apps rotate tokens after each request (most secure)
 *    - Others use one token per session (simpler)
 *    - Always rotate tokens after login/logout
 *
 * 5. COMBINING WITH OTHER DEFENSES
 *    - Use sameSite cookies (you already do!)
 *    - Check Origin/Referer headers (you already do in proxy.ts!)
 *    - CSRF tokens are an additional layer
